# Phishing Awareness Interactive Tool

I developed an interactive web tool designed to help employees recognize phishing emails and improve their cybersecurity awareness. The tool presents simulated email messages, and users must determine whether each message is legitimate or a phishing attempt. By encouraging users to carefully review and classify each email as "Report as Phishing" or "Mark as Safe," the tool reinforces critical thinking about common phishing cues and fosters better decision-making.

## Key Features

- **Simulated Email Messages**: Realistic email messages that include both legitimate and phishing scenarios.
- **Interactive Decision-Making**: Users engage by selecting "Report as Phishing" or "Mark as Safe" for each message.
- **Immediate Feedback**: After each response, users receive feedback to learn from incorrect answers.
- **Educational Summary**: At the end of the tool, users receive a summary that reinforces what to look for in phishing attempts.

This project exemplifies my commitment to enhancing cybersecurity through education, using user-friendly interfaces to train employees in recognizing and avoiding common threats.
